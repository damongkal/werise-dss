        The Weather-Rice-Nutrient integrated decision support system (WeRise) 
        Prototype is a computer-based decision support tool that provides 
        quick advice to farmers, researchers, and extension workers on 
        optimum planting time, variety to use, and amount and timing of 
        fertilizer application in rainfed rice areas under current and future 
        climate conditions.

        The Prototype integrates seasonal climate predictions (such as in Scale 
        Interaction Experiment - Frontier Research Center for Global Change -- 
        SINTEX-F) with crop growth models (such as ORYZA) as described in the 
        following publications:

        In developing WeRise, the IRRI-Japan Collaborative Research Project 
        used simplified representation of the effect of weather, crop and 
        nutrient management on rainfed rice systems. The project integrated 
        the output of three research themes (development of seasonal weather forecast, 
        rice genotype adapted to more drought and higher temperature, and nutrient 
        management) for calibration and evaluation of the weather and  crop models. 
        Simulated rice growth and development of different cultivars and improved 
        genotypes were compared with crop measurements under potential, 
        water-limited, and N-limited production situations.
